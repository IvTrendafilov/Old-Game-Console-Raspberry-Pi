## Introduction

The Interactive Game Console (IC) at a basic level aims to deliver the same experience other consoles do - effortless enjoyment of time spent. The advantage of a console for gaming has always been the simplicity of action – you just plug and play, and that’s what always differentiated it from the PC, it is simple to use and also brings some features not present on the PC. In that sense, our system aims to deliver the simple and reliable experience, but also introduce an important feature – new controls. The way a user interacts with a game is always through the controller, but traditional controllers have been around for more than a decade now and we wanted to rework a little bit the feel of controlling the game so we decided to go with a new touch control sensor system. After going through some ideas we decided to pair two different ideas that might work great together – old school games and new controlling schemes. In that way we can revitalize a small part of the old school genre through the means of modern input and experience, while retaining the old school look and gameplay. For this type of undertaking we needed the proper hardware – Raspberry Pi 4, some touch sensors, for a basic version of the product. We also have to pair it up with a pleasing and easy to understand user interface, which at the same time has to always stay responsive to the player input. Combining those ideas will result in a very nice way to revisit some old classics that we always wanted to and bring that arcade feel to other people as well. We will present our ideas through the means of some UML diagrams, mockup, requirements and fail states we derived, milestones that we have to achieve in development, how we prioritize the requirements and finally a conclusion to the whole design.

## Product User Interface

**(Create illustrations and design of your product and explain the tools used for the design. Include UML diagrams of your application for better understanding.)**

* Wireframing Tools 
* UML diagrams

The picture below is our activity diagram. Firstly, the player must turn on the console to have access to all the options we offer. After powering up, the system will display its user-friendly interface, where the player can choose from 3 options - to edit settings, to pick a game or to exit. When a game is picked, the system will automatically start it. While in-game, every player has the option to restart or exit the game. If one exits or finishes the game, he will be forwarded to the main menu once more.



## Requirements/System Overview 

**(Overall functionality of the system is explained with user requirements and functional requirements. Describe the scenario when your system can fail.)**

## Milestones

**(This is basically to understand the project scope. It should be described according to the number of jobs required for your application to the final deliverable.)**

## Requirement Priorities

**(You are required to prioritize the functionalities to build your Minimal Viable Product. It should be stated clearly.)**

## Conclusion

**(You can give the concluding statements of your document.)**
