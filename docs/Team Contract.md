## 4. Team meeting ground rules (Mention at least 3)

- Participation

We will have regular meetings(aside from the Scrum ones) in order to discuss how everyone is doing and help each other out

We would like everyone to participate in the meetings so that the team can be synchronized.

Of course we will arrange the meetings in a time suitable for everyone.

Everyone who cannot participate in a meeting must inform the others

- Communication

We want everyone to communicate with each other so that the team can work together

When someone is feeling sick or is busy we want them to inform the team if they will miss a meeting or cannot do a certain task.

When someone feels a task is too hard for them or they have too much work we want them to inform the team so that we can come up with a solution.

- Problem Solving

First the task is given to a specific number of members depending on the difficulty.

After that we would like a team member to mention during a meeting if he/she needs help for his share of work if he is incapable of doing it or is running late on the deadlines.

If a task proves too difficult to be handled by 1 or 2 members we will hold a meeting specifically for that task and then do it together as a team.

- Decision Making

We start by holding a meeting to determine what tasks need to be done. For example: making the presentation, the mockup, group contract, software design document.

After that we split the tasks between our members based on their strengths and team roles. We strive to have at least 2-3 members doing an important task.

Finally if a task is important and proves difficult we give it our full attention and do it as a team so that we can get it out of the way faster.

- Handling Conflict

We want everyone to respect each other. If it so happens that a conflict occurs we have the following rules:

The conflict topic must be informed to the entire team.

After that the team will discuss the conflict together as a whole and come up with a solution.

Members are not allowed to insult or act rude with each other in case of a conflict.
