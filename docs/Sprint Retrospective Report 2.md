## *Q1:* What are the things that went well during the last sprint? 
The things that went during the second sprint are: 
Organization - we were well organized and well informed with the things that had to be done during sprint two. We were also well aware of the documentation that had to be submitted in regards to the deadlines.
Task division - we divided the tasks that had to be done between the members with ease. Everyone had tasks which took into consideration his skills, or schedule as some had to do resits.
Team organization - the team was well organized in creating meetings outside the ones with TA’s.  We had a lot of meetings between us to talk about the things that need to be implemented and done for the sprint.
Team communication - everyone was well understanding of the situation of the other team members. If someone couldn’t complete something or had trouble or he had something more important(resit of exam/s), every team member was ready to help with his tasks.
Team collaboration - everyone from the team was able to work well with his partner without any significant problems. Everyone had a fun time working with his partner on a specific task that was given to them.


## *Q2:* What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
Things that could have been better during the last sprint.
Coming on time for scrum meetings- there were many times that one or more members of the team were a bit late for the meetings.
Better organization in an individual point of view - 2 of the members were late for the sprint two presentations. Which was not entirely their fault as they could have communicated with the TA’s about the interviews which they had for the OS assignments.
Better communication with TA’s - some of the times we did not provide important information to our TA’s until it was too late. Example - having an interview for the OS assignment near the time of the beginning of the sprint presentation. 
Preparation for scrum meetings - on some of the meetings we were not ready at all for them, as we had some questions that we wanted to ask but we were not entirely sure what we should ask or how we should ask it, and in the end we just didn’t ask it.
Confusion in the team - there was a bit of confusion between the team members. We had to submit a team contract on 6th October. We did the team contract the day before on the 5, but there was miscommunication on our part as we didn’t directly agree who would submit it. And in the end we ended up submitting it in gitlab on the 5, but didn’t submit the URL in Canvas.


## *Q3:* What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

### *a)* Domain specific level?
We were able to understand and make our touch sensors work without problems and receive input from them. 
We were also able to write one of the games with the pygame library.
We also created the user interface of our console with the pygame, though it was a bit tricky.
We learned that integrating the sensors with is not so easy so we first created a game that uses a keyboard.
Finally we learned that running pygame on the terminal was not possible and decided to download the VNC viewer to look at the Pi's desktop.



### *b)* intra-personal level?
We found out that we are able to work under a lot of pressure and limited time without a lot of problems. We had a limited amount of time to work on the project because of all the exams and resits and other assignments but we managed to stay calm and work it out.


## *Q4:* What are your plans for the next sprint?
In the next sprint the base idea is to ramp up development. In general, we are going to focus on implementing firstly the games integration with the touch sensors.  We plan on trying that first and foremost with Python due to its broad selection of libraries. After that we will start on a short design phase of the interface that has to interconnect the different games in one place. That would probably be done in a brainstorming session with ideas about how to do it. Right after that we will decide together on what tools to use for the implementation. We have discussed briefly a type of HTML/CSS solution, but that’s to be discussed. The decision will probably again be done as a quick meeting with discussions of different tools and ideas that we might use. If there’s still time until the end we might proceed onto development of the interface and deployment of the first developed game on it.


## *Q5:* Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.

| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5)                   |                   |
| Happy  (4)                        |  As always we could have been more organized and to have started work a little earlier in order to have space for mistakes, but in the end when we did our work, we did it pretty well and succeeded in the goals that we had set - mainly to clear up any flaws in the idea and to get to work on the sensor implementation.   
| Okay  (3)                         |                   |
| Sad  (2)                          |                   |
| Very  Sad (1)                     |                   |

## *Q6:* Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
The team member that was the most appreciated during the last sprint is Vladi Avramov. He was the one who made the presentation and later on was the presenter of the sprint review presentation. We feel like he was the one who took lead in sprint two and made us work as a team better.
## *Q7:*  Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)
As we are using the MoSCoW priority system.  We have now created one of our pygames, and a really simple user interface. We would like to work more on them as we want to make additional features in the games such as: game score, highest score, most played game etc.
