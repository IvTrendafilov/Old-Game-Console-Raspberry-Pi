## *Q1:* What are the things that went well during the last sprint?
During the last sprint, we got ourselves satisfactorily organized for one sprint of work, also everyone’s opinion is heard and considered as an option. We strive to take out the best ideas from all the team members and combine them into the answer of our dilemmas. Our project will be interesting and intriguing for all of us, which will make the work less stressful, while still being able to spend enough time on it. 

## *Q2:* What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
We could have chosen and executed the presentation a lot better. Since we hadn’t chosen a design beforehand, we chose one that we mostly didn’t like, but we had no time to change it last minute. After that we could have also been a little early for meetings since some of us were a little late a couple of times.

## *Q3:* What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

### *a)* Domain specific level?
For now the most important part is that we managed to get to grips with the Raspberry Pi on a beginner level. All of us managed to set it up and run a few commands, connect a couple of sensors, LEDs to see how they perform. Furthermore, we were able to fastly start working with Linux shell and commands, helping us in the process of understanding how the Pi functions.

### *b)* intra-personal level?

## *Q4:* What are your plans for the next sprint?
Our plans for the next sprint are:
Creating a design(visual) for the project
Creating a team contract
UML diagrams
Maybe create the interface of the project if we have time


## *Q5:* Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.

| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5)                   |                   |
| Happy  (4)                        |         We believe we did a decent job but were a missing  team synergy when creating the requirements analysis and Sprint review presentation. This is because we were not yet completely sure what our project will be about. This resulted in a lot of confusion misunderstandings regarding the requirements. Nevertheless we believe we made a nice and concise presentation that showed our intention. We plan to start designing our project in order for everyone to work on the same page.         |
| Okay  (3)                         |                   |
| Sad  (2)                          |                   |
| Very  Sad (1)                     |                   |

## *Q6:* Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
We believe it was Stefan Ilich because he was the presenter and he helped with creating the presentation.

## *Q7:*  Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)?
We consider using the MoSCoW priority system and our must objectives will be creating an user-friendly interface, with at least 1 properly working game. Also testing is something, which we do not want to miss, since this is how we can understand, if a function is working properly as expected. Priorities, outside developing the products, are doing regular meetings(beside the scrum ones) and most importantly helping each other, whenever one needs help.
