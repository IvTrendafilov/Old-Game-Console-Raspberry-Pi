## *Q1:* What are the things that went well during the last sprint?
The things that went well throughout the first sprint were:
Good organization. We were able to meet all the deadlines on time without any particular problems.
Good team spirit. We had no problems with having a lot of meetings and discussions about the project that we should make.
Good communication. Everyone considered the opinions and ideas of the other team members in regards to the project. And after a long discussion on some combinations of ideas we finally decided to make a project which would make everyone feel happy and satisfied after creation.
Good distribution of the work concerning the project. We were able to split all the work that had to be done during the sprint pretty well. Everyone had his fair share of work depending on the skills that he possessed.


## *Q2:* What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
The things that could have gone better during the first sprint are:
The presentation. We hadn't made the decision on who would be our presenter and we also had not made the presentation. We made those two important decisions 30 minutes before the sprint meeting which was a bad idea. The theme and slides of the presentation were chosen in the last minute and they didn't make us feel good about them but we had no other choice.
Coming on time for scrum meetings. There were a few times in which some were a bit late.
Being prepared for scrum meetings. There were a few times in which we didn’t remember who was the scrum master of the last meeting, or we would decide it at the last moment.
Asking more questions. We didn't ask almost any questions during the meetings.


## *Q3:* What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

### *a)* Domain specific level?
For now the most important part is that we managed to get to grips with the Raspberry Pi on a beginner level. All of us managed to set it up and run a few commands, connect a couple of sensors, LEDs to see how they perform. Furthermore, we were able to fastly start working with Linux shell and commands, helping us in the process of understanding how the Pi functions.

### *b)* intra-personal level?
Overall, we are a cohesive team, besides the amount of time we have been together. Helping each other is a priority for us. If someone has, for instance, resits or is not prepared enough for the test, the other team members will do their work, which is a good example of teamwork. 

## *Q4:* What are your plans for the next sprint?
First of all, we plan to do  a wireframe of our user interface to show how our users will be interacting with the system and starting games. We may also show a design of how some of our games would look like. After that we are going to discuss what UML diagrams we will make regarding our project and making a decision will make them as a team. Next we will make our Software design document and our team contract. We will also handle these tasks together as a team and not individually. Last but not least we plan to start programming our user interface in this Sprint if time allows it. We also want everyone to get familiar with the GPIO library and experiment with sensors.



## *Q5:* Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.

| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5)                   |                   |
| Happy  (4)                        |         We believe we did a decent job but were a missing  team synergy when creating the requirements analysis and Sprint review presentation. This is because we were not yet completely sure what our project will be about. This resulted in a lot of confusion misunderstandings regarding the requirements. Nevertheless we believe we made a nice and concise presentation that showed our intention. We plan to start designing our project in order for everyone to work on the same page.         |
| Okay  (3)                         |                   |
| Sad  (2)                          |                   |
| Very  Sad (1)                     |                   |

## *Q6:* Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
We believe it was Stefan Ilich because he was the presenter and he helped with creating the presentation. He was most active in creating the slides and he also expressed his enthusiasm for presenting. He was also very active in creating all of the needed documentaton throughout the Sprint while maintaining availabilty for all meetings.

## *Q7:*  Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)?
We consider using the MoSCoW priority system and our must objectives will be creating an user-friendly interface, with at least 1 properly working game. Also testing is something, which we do not want to miss, since this is how we can understand, if a function is working properly as expected. Priorities, outside developing the products, are doing regular meetings(beside the scrum ones) and most importantly helping each other, whenever one needs help.
