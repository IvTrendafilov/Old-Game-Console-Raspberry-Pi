## *Q1:* What are the things that went well during the last sprint?
The things that went well during the third sprint were:
Organization - despite the spring being only one week there were a lot of stuff that had to be done in such a short period of time. We were able to organize the team members good enough to manage with the assignments that had to be done in the sprint.
Communication - there were a lot of things that had to be discussed between the members of the team because of the demo presentation that had to be done at the end of the week.
Task division - the tasks that had to be done for the sprint were equally divided between every member of the team.
Requirements - all the requirements were fulfilled for the MVP of the project.
Team organization - everyone took particular responsibility and participated in the tasks that had to be finished for the sprint.


## *Q2:* What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
Meetings - there were some meetings on which not all team members came on time.
Organization - our organization outside of the one from the university could have been better 
Communication with the TA’s - we had some questions for the TA’s that we did not ask because we didn’t know how exactly to ask them.
Preparation for scrum meetings - for some of the meetings we were not fully prepared.
Uploading of relevant documents - there was a time in which we forgot to upload our scrum meetings reports to gitlab

## *Q3:* What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

### *a)* Domain specific level?
Pygame - we learned a lot of how the pygame library works, like for instance, movement of objects, integrate pictures, collision detection, etc.
Pygame-menu - we got to know how to create buttons, text fields, navigate through menus, create submenus and also integrate games with the menu.
Touch sensors - we got the basics of how the RPI.GPIO library works, but still it is not implemented in our program, as we have focused on properly functional menu, and games.
Python - we got used to the python syntax, as the previous programming language all of us used, is slightly different from python.
VNC Viewer - we had problems running pygame on the raspberry pi and the final tool, which the group decided to use is VNC Viewer. There isn’t much to research for the VNC, as the only purpose we use it for is visualization

### *b)* intra-personal level?
This sprint we grew as a team, because of the circumstances. Some of us had resits to take, and some didn’t and in that we found ourselves in the situation that we have to progress, but not all of us can work. And as a team the main goal was to progress and no one hesitated to continue working and leave room for people who have resits take their time to study. And in that we found ourselves in a good team with only the progress of the project in mind with the collaboration of a real team.
We are much more organized with our deadlines and meet almost every day to discuss what everyones is doing and if they need help. 

## *Q4:* What are your plans for the next sprint?
In the next sprint we are planning to finish all the games that we have started developing since the last sprint. After that we are planning on finishing the user interface as there are still some things that need to be done in it. After those two things are done, we are planning on integrating the touch sensors with the games and with the user interface so that we are sure that the touch sensors are usable with the games. After that we are planning on integrating all the games in the user interface so that users can choose between different games. After all of this is finished, we are thinking of removing all the bugs that might occur while we are implementing the games with the user interface and touch sensors and after finishing the MVP. If we also have time, we might add additional features to the game such as scoreboard etc.
## *Q5:* Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.

| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5)                   |                   |
| Happy  (4)                        |         We are mostly happy with our performance so far we delivered a good MVP, we were mostly on track with development, but we also could have been better at our time-management and work division, but mostly we are positive for our work.          |
| Okay  (3)                         |                   |
| Sad  (2)                          |                   |
| Very  Sad (1)                     |                   |

## *Q6:* Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
Ivan Trendafilov is this week’s most appreciated member. The reason being that with all our assignments, project meetings and exams, he still managed to spend time and weigh in on every meeting, decision, development and managed to sink in a ton of time on our Law assignment and helped so much that there was just no other option.
## *Q7:*  Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)?
For now, we have not found any new priotiries for the development of our product. We have already started the development of our product and the idea of what should be done is crystal clear to us. We now know what exactly has to be developed so that the product is useful and are working on developing them.
