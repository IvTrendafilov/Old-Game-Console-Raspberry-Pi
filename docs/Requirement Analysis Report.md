## Introduction
The Interactive Game Console (IC) is aimed at players that want to experience all time
classics through the power of touch and motion. All the games available will be playable via
touch or motion sensors completely reimagining the ways you play your game.

### Motivation
We want our users to experience retro gaming through modern means of interaction. The
Raspberry Pi will allow them to experience the classics on their laptop on their laptops and
we hope that this will motivate them to make their own retro games and add them to our
console.

###  Scope
We want to showcase how one can use the Raspberry Pi as a controller with touch and/or
motion sensors to play retro games on the computer. We strive to make a console which
has a user interface in which the user can select the game they want to play as well as
adjust some settings. The scope of our project will be making the user interface and
creating a few games. If users want to play games that are not available they will have to
program them themselves and add them to our console.

### Limitations of the current system (if any)
Only one player can use the IC at a time.

### Objectives
1. Create a user interface
2. Program a few games
3. Make a controller out of the Raspberry Pi and take input from touch and/or motion
sensors
4. Extensively test the functionality of the games.
5. Connect games to the interface and allow users to adjust their settings
6. Extensively test the functionality of the interactive console
7. Encourage users to make their own games.

### Definitions and Abbreviations 
Interactive Game Console - IC - based on a Raspberry Pi system with additional sensors for
input of controls
Raspberry Pi - small single-board computer

### Overview of the selected application
The application will look like several retro game consoles combined in one product. When
interacting with the product, the client will be able to choose from different games and play
by clicking on a number of touch sensors, located in front of the display. When a player
loses, he will be able to choose from either selecting a new game or restarting the current
one.

## Product Requirements
The system should be able to support at least 1 touch sensor
The system should be able to support at least 1 motion sensor
The system should have an online interface
The system should allow the user to play as many times as he wants

### Functional requirements
● As a player, I want to be able to pause a game.
● As a player, I want to be able to restart a game.
● As a player, I want to be able to choose from different games.
● As a player, I want to be able to interact with a user-friendly interface.
● As a player, I want to be able to navigate through the interface.
● As a player, I want to be able to see the rules and controls of a game.
● As a player, I want to be able to use touch and/or motion sensors connected to the
Raspberry Pi to play the games.
● As a player, I want to be able to change settings in the IC, so it suits my liking(such
as changing difficulty of the game).

### Nonfunctional requirements
● The responsive time of a touch sensor has to be at most 0.1 seconds.
● The system should be available 99,9% of the time.

## Conclusion
Gaming this generation has been more and more modernized with new types of controls, but old games can still be relevant and fun, so we're bringing them to the modern days via touch controls and new levels of fun to those games.
