**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
After couple of Belbin tests and projects I found myself always in the role of the Shaper. At every meeting, ad every working day I kept pursuing the newest goals and always pushing my teammates to strive for more features and always more quality in them. 

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? 
How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong? I try to organize couple of days ahead, so I have an idea of how I'll manage with a certain amount of work. If I have 3 lectures and work in the same day, I'll manage to organize it in such a way that I manage to do everything on time while also get enough sleep and have proper breaks throghout the day, so I manage 12-14 hours working. If my estimation goes wrong I generally tend to evaluate the importance of tasks and if a task is not that important, I just reschedule it for a next day.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?  
I always make a evaluation of which tasks are upcoming sooner so I prioritize them and try to schedule everything else around that. The specific criteria is that the closest tasks get the highest priority.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project? 
I always stay in touch with my teammates and almost always work in a pair and we talk through the whole process of design/implementation/quality assurance (testing). Along with that I sync with the other parts of a project, that I'm not working on during meetings, sessions and anytime when a teammate gets in contact with me.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
During a meeting I always speek in a casual fasion, without any specialities. I generally spend around 5 minutes talking in a 20 minute meeting. And I always give feedback to a colleague as I see something I can give feedback for, in that way we can improve the quality of working drastically.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed? 
First of all, it is most important that a team should decide on a set of features that the user won't be able to use the application to the fullest. Therefore, first, a team should focus on those features and if there completed on time, it is absolutely complete. But in case the team accomplishes the features and assures the quality of the features, the additional features are always a good thing for the consumer.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
Evaluation is one of the most important parts of developing a project. In order for a team to be productive and imrpove, they should always work through difficulties and address them as soon as possible together. With my colleagues I try to point out things as soon as I notice something and also try to fix things my colleagues tell me for my work.
