**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?

For myself, I would prefer the role of Implementer or Complete Finisher, because I really enjoy surfing through the internet to
look up for all kinds of possible solutions to a problem and picking the one, which will fit most efficiently in our implementation,
as well as organizing the work, which has to be done, depending on the skills of each team member. Also fixing bugs is one of the most
stress relieving moments of programming for me.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?

Personally, some days I can be much more productive than i planned to be, but other days I can waste half of my day. I always try to
compensate as much as I can, spending more time on university tasks rather than cleaning or cooking. On average I spend half of my mornings
and my whole afternoons studying or leaning new things.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?

I always do a brief lookup of all the tasks I have to do and then decide from where will i start. For instance, now i have left out the 
math lectures, since there are upcoming exams for the other subjects, also project deadlines are soon and every weekend, I spend some time
on math, so I do not get far behind. Always the most fundamental tasks, should be prioritized.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
	
The easiest way for me to follow the progress of the project is by attending SCRUM meetings, because everybody says what he has done,
what will he do and this gives me an overview of how the work goes. Other thing I do is to check the commit messages in GitLab.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?

I consider the meetings we do, that are more of an overview of what has been done until now, because the communication between us is not
only through meetings. We always give feedback to each other, even critizing ourselves, after all this is the way to improve your skills.
We spend around 10 minutes on meetings, after that we communicate only if someone needs help or it is stuck somewhere or if you do not 
understand some requirement you have to implement.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

I can never decide the requirements of my applicaton. Always you must speak with client and stakeholders, what do they need, do they
consider the requirements as a finished overview of the application and of course me as a developer, i should say if they are doable.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 

I think evaluation is the most realistic assessment of your productivity, as you may think yourself as a very good and productive doing something,
but this may be your own reality. So when clients evaluate your product, you can realize how have you done your job. If in my opinion things
are not going well at some point, I would always tell everybody, what we should fix in my opinion and ask of theirs as well.
