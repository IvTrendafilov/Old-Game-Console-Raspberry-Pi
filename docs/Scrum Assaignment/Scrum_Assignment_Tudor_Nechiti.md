## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
Answer:  After having the chance of developing software using Agile Development in the module 4 of last year, I came to the conclusion that
the roles that I enjoy the most in a team are those of teamworker, since I always try to adhere to my team's plans and I think there is always
a way to reach common ground, if there is cooperation, which I value the most.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your
productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
Answer: On a scale from 1 to 10 I consider myself 7 productive. One of the reasons that I might fail being productive, is that I sometimes tend to
procrastinate, which is an issue that I've been trying to solve for some time. Nevertheless, this applies only when I don't have urgent things to
hand in, otherwise I get the job done in time(for example if there is an upcoming deadline). I mostly overcome my issues by thinking about my teammates
that also put a lot of effort in a project, thing that makes me increase my productivity and my focus, since I do not want to dissapoint.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you
follow every time?
Answer: Careful planning beforehand helps me most of the times, especially in big projects, where software needs to be built carefully, step by step.
For example, while working with Agile, a carefully thought Sprint with well thought epics and user stories, as well as estimation, helps me choose what
steps I need to follow in order to reach that goal. I always view epics and user stories as a guide.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
Answer: I always try to stay up to date to every changed made throughout the project. At the same time, I try to contribute as much as possible
in any way, whether it be programming or documenting software. If I have any impediments during my time working on a project, I don't hesitate
to ask my teammates, in order to solve my problems as fast as possible. 

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during
meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
Answer: I am always on time and I tend to talk a lot with my teammates, since most of the times I want to convey my thoughts to each one of them.
When it comes to daily stand-up meetings, I stay until the end and sometimes I come with a proposal that we extend our meeting, if any of us had
any problems during the project development. I don't always give feedback, because that depends on the person whom I talk with, whether he is fine
accepting feedback or not, but most of the times I give my thoughts on every matter.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your
criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
Answer: There is always a big brainstorming session in order to decide the requirements of an application. I can't think of a specific criteria
to decide if the product is completed. I don't think a project is ever "completed", and it can always be developed further more, but if the 
requirements have been met and testing + documentation has been done properly, I assume the application is ready to be released.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess
yourself and your Colleagues?
Answer: Definitely. In order for things to go flawlessly, communcation needs to be on point and this also means that evaluation of the team members
is important. Throughout the project development, I observe how my teammates work and how productive they are(obviously, that applies to myself as well)
and then I try to act accordingly, without upsetting anyone, by giving them my opinions about what went well/wrong in their work.
