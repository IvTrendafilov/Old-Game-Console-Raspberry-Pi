## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
 I prefer implementer because i feel that i am a practical, efficient and reliable person that likes to turn ideas into work.

I am very productive sometimes, but there are times when emotionl problems occur and ruin the program that i set. On average I would say i am 80% productive.
## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I think of the tasks that are the most importat to me, and I weight the tasks that I have to do so that I can arrange how much I work on each one.

We spend 15 minutes on average during scrum meetings in which everyone helps everyone else be up to date with each other's work.
## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
I put myself in the shoes of the consumer and I think with the help of stakeholders what the final product should look and function like.	
## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues?
Evaluation is indeed important for productivity because it can emphasize the aspects that went good and the ones that went wrong and can help at better planning in the future and also at 
organizing work. Evaluation bring the wrong and the good up to surface.# Assignment - Scrum
