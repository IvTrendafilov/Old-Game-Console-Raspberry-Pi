**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
 I prefer implementer because i feel that i am a practical, efficient and reliable person that likes to turn ideas into work.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
I am very productive sometimes, but there are times when emotionl problems occur and ruin the program that i set. On average I would say i am 80% productive. I try to keep a 
positive mood at all time because I know how much it influences my productivity. I sometimes procastinate and I recently found out why, because I subconsciously think that to be
succesfull you have to suffer, so for me procastination is making me suffer so I can feel that I can have succes. This is something that I have been working on for a while.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I think of the tasks that are the most importat to me, and I weight the tasks that I have to do so that I can arrange how much I work on each one.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
I look at what needs to be done, which is decided in the planning fase, and I compare it to the current work.	 

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
We spend 15 minutes on average during scrum meetings in which everyone helps everyone else be up to date with each other's work. "Comunication is key" is something that I truly
believe in, because in a team, helping each other, knowing about each other's work and problems is strongly needed so that actions can be made to improve efficiency, therefore 
delivering a better product. Usually in meeting I try to tell my teammates everything I worked on so that we can all be up to date, as well as my problems because I know that 
my teammates are the first persons I should ask for help regarding the project.

# Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
I put myself in the shoes of the consumer and I think with the help of stakeholders what the final product should look and function like. I try to think of the final product,
visualise how it would look and function like, what me, as a consumer I would want to see in the product. My personal way of deciding requirements is thinking of a complete 
session of using the product in which I try and think or every requirement needed throughout the session of using the product and after that I think of the special events, and
functionalities, and the more unsual behaviors of the product in different less likely events.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues?
Evaluation is indeed important for productivity because it can emphasize the aspects that went good and the ones that went wrong and can help at better planning in the future and also at 
organizing work. Evaluation bring the wrong and the good up to surface. So far so good, meaning that I met my colleagues and they all seem serious and motivated to accomplish
a good product, even thought the past weeks have also been split in this year's module and the last one with the tests. We are all trying to work as much as possible given the
circumstances, and I think everyone should evaluate themselves to improve their efficiency.
