**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why? 
I perceive myself as having the Teamworker role in most of my projects. This is because I am always cooperating with the others to create something and do work on behalf
of the team. I tend to avoid confrontation and agree with the most popular idea offered.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
I am often productive as I work with the team and make sure that no work is left unattended. If someone needs a second hand I am always there to assist. In case that currently
all work is split between the members, I ask if anyone needs help and if eveyone is doing fine I start working on a future task.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I prioritize what has to be done right now and after that I start with the most difficult task we have. Most of the time I am not doing it alone but with another team member and
we help each other out.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
I often check who has done what and ask if anyone needs help. If everyone is doing fine I start doing another task and check our deadlines to 
make sure that everyone will finish on time.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
In a meeting I am often the one who offers my help in doing tasks and and if noone replies, I wait for everyone to decide what they will be doing and then I start everything
that is left. I always make sure that everyone is one the right track and that immediate tasks will be done. I stay during the entire meeting and leave last. I also give
feedback to the work that everyone is doing and if someone is doing a task with a close deadlline I start working with him if I see that he is having trouble.


## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
I decide the requirements with everyone else and never decide something on my own. I am usually not the one that comes up with an idea but the one that helps in executing it. For me
a product is genuinely complete if everyone is satisfied with the outcome and all the requirements are met. Generally if everyone is happy with the outcome I would be too.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
I believe that evaluation is very important because everyone has to work together to create a completed product. This means that important tasks must be approved by all members. 
They should give feedback in order to make sure that the tasks are done right. I usually ask my teammates for evaluation but I also assess myself by how useful I have been in doing 
the most important tasks and meeting the deadlines.
