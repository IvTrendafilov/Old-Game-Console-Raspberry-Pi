**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I prefer to be a Specialist, as I am used to mostly working alone, and focusing on one task at a time.

## *Q2:* How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?

If we scale productivity from 1 to 10, I would say around 8-9, depending on my motivation. I like to do things as fast as possible withouth wasting much time,
so if for some reason the estimation goes wrong I would be ready to loose sleep, so that we could finish the things that we have to.

## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?

The way I prioritize tasks is that, the basic tasks must be done in the begining, after that follow the most important tasks, and after that you can go
with the features that are less needed but make the application cool. 

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?

I try to set different timelines for tasks, as of when they should be finished, and normally try to finish them at least 2 days before the deadline.

## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?

Depends on the meating, if we need to discuss some features for the project I tend to spend around 10-15 minutes, if we need to discuss
the design of the project or the code around 30-40 minutes, if someone needs help or if I need help as much time as needed to finish.

## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

The way I decide the requirements is that I look at it as a user, do I need to stuff do I like them, would I usem them. If all my criteria are
fullfiled I get the feeling that the project is completed.

## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 

I think that evaluation is really important for productivity, this is the easiest way to see how much work someone is doing
and how are things going on in the project. I try to assess myself as hard as I can so that I wont slack off, while I try to go easy
on other people/Colleagues because I do not like to get in confrontations with them for that kind of stuff.
